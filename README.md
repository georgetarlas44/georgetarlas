<h1>My name is George Tarlas </h1>
<h1 style="color:Purple;"My name is George Tarlas</h1>
<p>I am a football player for Weber State Universtity, I am married to my wife Brittney
she is amazing and we have two puppies together which makes our lives really happy. We can't wait 
to be done with school, and go explore the life outside of utah, somewhere in Texas close to dallas.</p>
<p1> My goal is to make it in the NFL so I can have the life I always dreamed of. Where you don't have 
to worry about a thing because you pay everybody to do it for you and you are stress free making money
monthly from investments. While I take care of my family as well!! </p1>
